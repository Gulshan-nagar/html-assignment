  <h2>Chemistry Assignment</h2>
  <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, compsotion and behaviour of matter. It is a facinating field that explore the building block of universe</p>
  <h3>Chemical Elements</h3>
  <p>The <span>periodic table </span>is a tabular arrangment of chemical elemnts Each elelment is represent by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for classifed into groups and periods based on their properties</p>
  <h4>Chemical Equations</h4>
  <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i> Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i></p>
  <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> - 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
  <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen has (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>
  <h5>Important Concepts</h5>
  <p>Stoichiometry is the calculation of reatants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equation to ensure mass and charge are conserved. <sub>subscripts</sub> indicats the nuber of each elemnts in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts </sup> represent charge or the nuberof atoms in an ion.</p>
 <h6>Conclusion</h6>
 <p>Chemistry plays a crusial role in understanding the world around us. From the compsotion of the air we breathe to the reaction that power our bodies, chemistry influces every aspect of our lives.</p>
